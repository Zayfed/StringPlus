# StringPlus
## Description
This project implements several functions from the string.h library along with tests. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how string processing functions operate in the C programming language. Throughout the development process, we analyze existing auxiliary functions for string manipulation and explore how various data types are converted into strings.

## Features
* Implementation of key functions from the string.h library.
* Custom implementation of the sprintf function.
* Tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented functions
